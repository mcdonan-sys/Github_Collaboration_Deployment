What did you ask Copilot to help you build? How did you break down the problem?-I asked GitHub Copilot to help me build a web-based task management application using React and Node.js. The goal was to implement core features like task creation, and deadline tracking. I broke down the problem into manageable components like: setting up the backend API, connecting it to a database, creating frontend components, and handling user interactions.
I started by drafting basic API routes, then moved on to building out the React components, one screen at a time. I also separated concerns by creating utility functions, middleware, and reusable components with Copilot's assistance.
How did your approach to asking questions change as you worked?-At first, my questions were broad and open-ended. But as I progressed and gained more context, my prompts became more specific and structured. I learned that Copilot performs better with detailed context and specific goals. So I adjusted by providing inline comments, writing partial code snippets, and asking for help in smaller chunks of logic.
What parts of the development process with GitHub Copilot surprised you?-I was surprised by how well Copilot could infer what I was trying to build based on function names or comments.
What did you learn about the technology you used that you didn't know before?-Copilot exposed me to modern syntax and patterns I hadnâ€™t used much before, such as destructuring in parameter lists or using enums in TypeScript.
What would you do differently if you had to build this again?-If i had to build this again I would most likely write clearer comments and function outlines to steer Copilot more precisely.
